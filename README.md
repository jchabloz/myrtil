# Myrtil is a lightweight requirement management tool

## About the name

Myrtil, the name of our requirements management tool, was chosen for its
association with the **Meadow brown** butterfly (Maniola jurtina). In French,
this butterfly is called "Myrtil". Just as the butterfly is known for its
graceful, seemingly effortless flight, our tool is designed to be
**lightweight** and agile. It avoids the heavy, cumbersome features of
traditional requirements management software, allowing users to navigate their
projects with ease and efficiency. ðŸ¦‹

The name Myrtil also has a clever linguistic twist. The phrase "**Myrtil** is a
lightweight requirements management tool" is nearly a **recursive acronym**,
similar to how **GNU** stands for "GNU's Not Unix."
